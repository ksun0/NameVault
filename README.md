# NameVault

### How It Works

In modern MMOs and other multiplayer games, character customization has proven itself to be one of the most important components to player experience. If you're going to sink five hundred hours into a game, you should feel good doing it right? The pinnacle of this comes from your characters name. It is the label by which you are known throughout the realm and the title through which you stake your reputation. It is yours and yours alone.

Unfortunately, over time the most desired names have been taken in popular games. That's where NameVault comes in. By allowing users to easily search for name availability across multiple servers, and providing free tracking, it can help you get the name you deserve.
